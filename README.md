HANDWRITTEN CHARACTER RECOGNITION MODEL:
A handwritten character recognition model is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) system, typically based on deep learning, that is designed to identify and classify handwritten characters from images.

These models are widely used in various applications, such as digitizing handwritten notes, processing forms, and enabling automated data entry.

Model Architecture:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): The most commonly used architecture for handwritten character recognition due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images. 

CNNs consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected (dense) layers

Input Layer:
Shape: For grayscale images, the shape might be (height, width, 1), for instance, (28, 28, 1) for MNIST digits.

Convolutional Layers (Conv2D):

Purpose: Extract features from the input images using learnable filters.

Activation Function: Usually ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to introduce non-linearity.

Pooling Layers (MaxPooling2D):

Purpose: Reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the feature maps, thereby reducing the number of parameters and computations in the network.

Flatten Layer:

Purpose: Converts the 2D matrix of features into a 1D vector to be used by the fully connected layers.
Fully Connected (Dense) Layers:

Purpose: Perform high-level reasoning and classification based on the features extracted by the convolutional layers.
Activation Function: Typically ReLU for hidden layers and softmax for the output layer to provide class probabilities.

Output Layer:

Purpose: Produce the final classification output.
Activation Function: Softmax for multi-class classification, providing a probability distribution over the classes
